# The Flower App 2

Sally is now ready to sell her flowers. Modify the app you have previously written for her in a way that
enables her to be able to use the flowers within sale order lines.

Note that Sally wants to sell flowers and only flowers.

# The Flower App 3 (OPTIONAL)

Sally discovered that she could sell her flowers online. Edit the appropriate template to add the additional 
flower fields to the website
