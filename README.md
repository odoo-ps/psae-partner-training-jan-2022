# The Flower App 1

Sally runs a flower shop. She wants to use odoo in order to run her daily tasks smoothly. 
This store grows its own flowers in a garden nearby. 

Those flowers have a set of different attributes. Help Sally by creating an app that includes 
a list of flowers.

Each flower has the following attributes:
- Common Name
- Scientific Name
- Season (Hint: use 2 date fields)
- Watering frequency (Example: Watering frequency = 3 ==> should be watered once every 3 days)
- Watering amount (In milliliters)
