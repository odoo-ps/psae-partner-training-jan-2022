# The Flower App 6

Sally finds the watering record system a bit inconvenient. She wants the following changes:

- only users with group "gardner" should be able to water the plants
- If a plant some lots that need watering, the 'product.template' form view should have a red ribbon 
"NEEDS WATERING"
- The serial number of flowers should be drawn from a sequence stored on the product itself
